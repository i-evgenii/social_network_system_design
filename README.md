- Site usage averages 1 time per day by 1 user;
- On average, there are 10 posts in a userâ€™s feed;

## Basic calculations
- RPS (viewing main user page) = 10 000 000 * 1 / 86 400 ~= 115
- RPS (viewing other user posts) = 10 000 000 * 10 / 86 400 ~= 1150
- RPS (creating posts) = 10 000 000 * 0.1 / 86 400 ~= 12
- Traffic = 1277 * 100Kb = 128Mb/s
- Connections = 10 000 000 * 0.1 = 1 000 000
